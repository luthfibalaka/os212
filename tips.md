## TIPS

1. Learn C Language: Learning C language for this class is important so I absolutely recommend you to learn about it.

2. Read a good OS reference book: Based from my experience, learning from book is the best way to fully grasp the material being taught and OS class is no difference.

3. Try and understand Weekly Demos: It's really helping me to understand each week's concept and I recommend you to do the same.
