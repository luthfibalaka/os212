## TIPS

1. Learn C Language: Learning C language for this class is important so I absolutely recommend you to learn about it.

2. Read a good OS reference book: Based from my experience, learning from book is the best way to fully grasp the material being taught and OS class is no difference.

3. Try and understand Weekly Demos: It's really helping me to understand each week's concept and I recommend you to do the same.

4. Finish all the assignments: Even if you skipped a week or more, you have to finish the corresponding assignments becuase there are some kinds of dependency that requires you to finish previous week's assignments in order to finish current week's assignments.
